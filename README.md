# Novo_Stitch
Novo&amp;Stitch is a genome assembly reconciliation tool based on optical map.
Novo&Stitch is an assembly reconciliation tool which takes advantage of optical maps to accurately carry out assembly reconciliation. One or more optical maps are used to obtain coordinates for the contigs, which are then stitched based on their alignments. The presence of the optical map dramatically reduces the complexityof the problem and the possibility of a misjoin. Combinatorial optimization models and technologies such as graph model, dynamic programming, weighted vertex cover model on hypergraph, greedy strategy, linear programming are used for solving some subproblems like data reduction, error correction and post-processing. 
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Novo&Stitch can significantly improve the contiguity of de novo genome assemblies without introducing misassembles or reducing completeness.
Until now, Novo&Stitch can only run on Unix/Linux systems.
